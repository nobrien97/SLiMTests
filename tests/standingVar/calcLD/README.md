# Linkage disequilibrium

I calculated pairwise LD for all biallelic locus pairs at up to four stages during adaptation: when populations reached 25%, 50%, 75%, and 90% of the way to the optimum. I used Lewontin's D' statistic, which ranges from -1 to 1. Imagine we have two alleles at different genes, A and B. D' = -1 means that A is always on a different genetic background to B, or vice versa. D' = 1 means that A and B are always inherited together. D' = 0 means there is no LD.

The expectation is that positive epistasis can generate positive LD by favouring the inheritance of coadapted gene complexes. Likewise, negative epistasis favours interacting loci to be inherited separately, leading to an excess of negative LD. Negative LD can persist in the population for long periods, as the combinations together tend to reduce the genetic variance in fitness and thus the rate of adaptation. So, if populations harbour large amounts of negative LD (either generated by negative epistasis or by stabilising selection), recombination should be favoured to increase the variance in fitness, increasing the rate of adaptation.

This figure shows the distribution of LD after adaptation.
The persistent trend is that increasing recombination reduces the number of biallelic sites, leading to smaller counts and it increases the amount of unlinked sites. Negative LD is much higher than positive LD in all models, so recombination should be favoured. We found a lot of positive epistasis in these models, so this LD seems to be generated moreso by selection than by the epistasis itself. The evidence for this is that the additive model has similarly negative LD as well as the NAR models. 


Did this look any different at the start of the adaptive walk?

Overall what have we seen?

- Models produce positive fitness epistasis, but negative LD (seems illogical?)
- K+ produces slightly positive trait epistasis, K- produces slightly negative trait epistasis (aside from outliers with very large trait epistasis)
- Adaptation is affected by recombination when there are many loci and increases the response to selection depending on the size of effects
  - with small effects, recombination greatly improves additive and K- models the most, K+ is barely affected (it started fast): K+ is resilient to small effects
  - with larger effects, NAR models slows down with increasing recombination, and with really big effects, the additive model does as well
- Phenotypic variance is similar: increased with recombination in all models, depending on tau
  - small effects: K+ is most increased
  - moderate effects: NAR models similar, additive increases and stays stable over time
  - large effects: K+ is unstable, K- can't maintain as much variance, big spike in variance with increased recombination in K- and additive
- LD seems to decrease with recombination under K- and additive more readily than K+
