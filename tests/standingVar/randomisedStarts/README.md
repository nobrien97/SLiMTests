# Randomised starting points

How robust are the results to randomised KXZ and KZ values? To test this, we looked at the tau = 0.0125, r = (1e-10, 1e-5, 1e-1), nloci = 1024 treatments for K- and K+. We ran 48 replicates per treatment with K_Z and K_XZ drawn uniformly from [0.5,2].

6 models * 48 = 288 cores
