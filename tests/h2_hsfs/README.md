# Half-Sib/Full-sib Crossing Design

Test to run the heritability code using a fixed pedigree to ensure the D matrix has enough relatedness.
Sampling every 50 gens for 2000 generations for 41 total samples.
I'm running 720 replicates per model (NAR/Additive) for a total 720 * 41 = 29520 models
Sampling 1000 individuals instead of 500 this time, and with N = 5000 instead of N = 10000 for perf
