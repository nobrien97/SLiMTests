gen: Simulation generation - at gen 50000 the optimum shifts
seed: replicate/seed for SLiM's RNG
modelindex: 1 = additive; 2 = NAR
mutType: molecular trait the mutation affects - in additive models, there is only mutType = 3 (QTL); in NAR 3 = aZ, 4 = bZ
mutID: the id of the mutation in SLiM - unique within a replicate only (i.e. seed 1 id 1 != seed 2 id 1) 
pos: position along the genome
constraint: N/A
originGen: generation the mutation originated
value: additive effect on molecular trait
chi: scaled mutation size x = value * sqrt(n)/2d where n is the number of traits the mutation affects (1) and d is the distance from the optimum
Freq: Allele frequency
Count: Count of genomes with the mutation
fixGen: generation the allele fixed (N/A in this dataset)
fixTime: approximate time to fixation
aZ, bZ, KZ, KXZ: mean molecular trait values (N/A for additive models)
phenomean: mean population phenotype
w: mean population fitness
isAdapted: is the population within 5% of the optimum (1.9 > x > 2.1)
avFit: fitness effect of the mutation relative to the population mean
avFX: phenotype effect of the mutation relative to the population mean (in additive models this is just value)
