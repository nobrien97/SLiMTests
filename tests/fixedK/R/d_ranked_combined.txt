rank: adaptive step in the walk: rank 1 is the first step, step 0 is the phenotype mean at the optimum shift
seed: replicate/seed for SLiM's RNG
modelindex: 1 = additive; 2 = NAR
mutType: molecular trait the mutation affects - in additive models, there is only mutType = 3 (QTL); in NAR 3 = aZ, 4 = bZ
value: additive effect on molecular trait
aZ, bZ, KZ, KXZ: mean molecular trait values (N/A for additive models)
phenomean: mean population phenotype
w: mean population fitness
avFit: fitness effect of the mutation relative to the population mean
avFX: phenotype effect of the mutation relative to the population mean (in additive models this is just value)
isAdapted: is the population within 5% of the optimum (1.9 > x > 2.1)
