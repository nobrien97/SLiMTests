# Heritability test: fixing molecular traits at different values

In this test I continue from h2_moltrait_fix by fixing molecular traits at different values instead of just at 1.
I do this by introducing a mutation that fixes in generation 1, setting the values of the parameter.

I run this model with 5% selection only, 1000 loci, and small effects (0.1).
There are four fixed values for the parameters (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2) and 48 replicates for 192 total models
