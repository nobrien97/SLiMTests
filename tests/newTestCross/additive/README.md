# New Test Cross - Additive runs

Just some additive models to run for comparison to the NewTestCross data
Don't have any SUs for NCI, so will hae to use Tinaroo :(
That limits the number of nodes/cores we can use
The cores are a bit slower than NCI, but we can hold on to them for longer so we'll do multiple runs per core
on NCI a network run takes ~15 hours, but network models run more slowly than additive models
so say it takes 15 hours for an additive run on the old Tinaroo cores
1440 runs total, if each core does 2 that's 720 cores needed or 30 nodes and should take ~30 hours
